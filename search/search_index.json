For any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact support via Slack/ email . Quick Setup: Web GUI Silimate Platform should be already installed and properly running on your CAD server. If it is not, see Installation and/or Infrastructure , or contact support. Port forwarding (recommended) To access the GUI on your local machine, you need to provide an SSH tunnel into the CAD server with port forwarding . To do this, add the argument -L 80:192.168.49.2:80 to your ssh command, for example: sudo ssh -Y -i testing_ec2.pem -L 80:192.168.49.2:80 ec2-user@ec2-XX-XX-X-XXX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com NOTE: you may need root privileges on your local machine to forward to port 80, hence sudo in the above command. Now, you should be able to navigate to http://localhost on your local browser and the platform web GUI should appear. X11 forwarding/VNC Assuming you have X11 forwarding/VNC setup between your local machine and the CAD server, you may simply open a remote browser session (e.g., firefox ) and navigate to http://192.168.49.2 . NOTE: this approach may be less responsive than port forwarding. Quick Setup: CLI Silimate Platform should be already installed and properly running on your CAD server. If it is not, see Installation and/or Infrastructure , or contact support. CAD Server Setup Ensure requests library for python3 is installed: python3 -m pip install requests Add to your .profile (or equivalent shell init script): export SILIMATE_ENDPOINT=192.168.49.2 export SILIMATE_PASSWORD=Silimate1234%4321etamiliS export PATH=$PATH:/silimate/cli Restart your shell and test with smake -l . You should see a list of all the available flows, something like: example-verilator-sim (active, paused) example-yosys-syn (active, paused) gcd-genus-syn (active) gcd-genus-syn-step (active) Local Machine Setup Make sure that SSH port forwarding is set up correctly. See Quick Setup: Web GUI Clone the CLI to your local machine path <CLI_DIRECTORY> (wherever you desire): git clone https://github.com/silimate/cli/ <CLI_DIRECTORY> Ensure the first line of <CLI_DIRECTORY>/smake points to your python3 interpreter path, e.g.: #!/usr/local/bin/python3 Ensure requests library for python3 is installed: python3 -m pip install requests Add to your .profile (or equivalent shell init script): export SILIMATE_ENDPOINT=localhost export SILIMATE_PASSWORD=Silimate1234%4321etamiliS export PATH=$PATH:<CLI_DIRECTORY> Restart your shell and test with smake -l .
